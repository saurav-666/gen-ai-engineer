Smart story
A smarter future
						for aerospace, driven by collaboration
A conversation with Lindsey Berckman, Deloitte
						Consulting principal
February 2024 |
							Deloitte Consulting





The process of implementing smart manufacturing solutions is like opening a combination lockâcountless
					possibilities, yet the right set can unlock a world of untapped potential. Thatâs what Lindsey Berckman,
					principal with Deloitte Consulting and a Smart Manufacturing leader, discovered when working with an aerospace
					and defense manufacturing company.
To help crack the code to smart manufacturing excellence, we introduced the aerospace manufacturer to
					Deloitteâs Smart Manufacturing ecosystemâincluding other Deloitte clients and our alliance ecosystemâduring a
					visit to The Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita. The goal was to show that anything is possible.








Building the platform, versus deploying the point solution,
								is so important because the second youâre able to solve for one problem and expose the data, youâre able
								to see what you can solve for next.
â Lindsey BerckmanPrincipal, Deloitte Consulting
							








Lining up for takeoff
The aerospace company came to Deloitte to monitor and action statistical process control (SPC) on machining
						processes to maintain product quality. And quality is of the utmost importance for an aerospace
						manufacturer, as the smallest incorrect machine settings can result in quality escapes.
The slightest deviation in product specifications is enough to scrap the part, which can result in
					upward of a $500,000 loss. Thereâs no room for error.
While the initial ask centered around understanding their SPC and operational efficiency, that target
					quickly expandedâa common occurrence with smart manufacturing endeavors. As Berckman explains, âWe reframed
					[the end goal] multiple times over, and thatâs how smart manufacturing projects should work. Itâs a snowball
					effectâthe second you solve one problem and expose the data, youâre able to see what you can solve for next.â
					
Transformation fueled by collaboration
To help bring the strategy to life, we tapped into a resource that elevates the value we deliver at The
						Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita: our client ecosystem. By comparing the challenges that the company was
						experiencing, we were able to identify a commercial aerospace company that faced similar obstacles. âTheyâre
						both regulated by the same agencies, and they know the same problems. Thereâs a lot of goodness that can
						happen with that kind of collaboration,â says Berckman.
By building this connection among aerospace leaders, we made strategic connections to help inform the
						transformation road map. The aerospace manufacturer was able to see firsthand, tangible results driven by
						smart manufacturing solutions directly related to their industry. With this newfound knowledge, the
						aerospace company fully embraced a smart manufacturing-fueled future.




Approaching a smarter future together
With a defined strategy, Deloitte teamed with the client to bring the plan to action. In addition to
				implementing the initial SPC solution, Berckman helped ignite a full-scale smart manufacturing transformation.
				This digital network enabled greater connectivity across the shop floor, machining processes, and production.
			
And with greater connectivity comes more quality data. Upon launch, the aerospace company experienced a 10â15%
				uptick in overall equipment effectiveness and a tenfold decrease in indirect laborâresults that show the
				immediate impact of being able to see your asset performance.
Smart manufacturing is about turning todayâs small wins into tomorrowâs large-scale victoriesâand thatâs
				happening as we speak. The solutions that The Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita brought to life for the
				aerospace company are now informing a blueprint for an enterprise-wide smart manufacturing initiative to be
				deployed across the parent company.
As we continue to ideate and create with the aerospace company, we are positioning their leaders to become
				tech-driven trailblazers in their field.
The digital innovations of smart manufacturing are not mere flights of fancy. They are cutting-edge solutions
				that are propelling the digital future of tomorrow. As the combinations of these solutions continue to reveal
				the aerospace companyâs full potential, The Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita is helping them unlock the
				possible.

Power up: A
						smarter journey for a transformer manufacturer
A conversation with Deloitteâs Rick Burke and Jon Tidd
					
January 2024 |
							Deloitte Consulting





Transformers convert electricity from one voltage to anotherâa change that goes unnoticed by many. But not
					all transformations are so subtle, especially when it comes to smart manufacturing transformations. Deloitte
					Smart Manufacturing leaders Rick Burke and Jon Tidd are helping a transformer manufacturer take on a massive
					transformation of its own, fueled by a powerful cloud-enabled, integrated industrial development platform.
					Paired with a comprehensive workflow and workforce plan that was brought to life at The Smart Factory by
					Deloitte @ Wichita experiential center, the manufacturer is poised to power tomorrowâs possibilities with
					todayâs leading solutions.
"Changing currents"
The transformer manufacturer came to Deloitte with a lofty goal to reach by the end of 2024: 700,000
					transformers, a 40% uptick in units produced at its factories. Its initial focus was on operational capacity
					in order to reach that goal, but a deep evaluation revealed hidden problems and big opportunities for growth.
				
At first, this sparked conversations around supply chain optimization. Burke and Tidd explored ways to
					enhance the companyâs supply chain efficiency through tech implementation, supply assurance, and other avenues
					to strengthen overall capacity. However, a closer look revealed another more urgent problem: workforce
					retention.
The post-COVID surge in attrition at the manufacturer was alarmingly high: 50% of new hires quit within the
					first 90 days, and the company was losing 30% of its workforce annually. How do you increase production if
					youâre constantly training new workers? This discovery required a complete shift in the entire solution
					strategyâone that takes a âbig pictureâ approach.







Collaboration: The power source of value
To help remedy the workforce woes, Deloitteâs Smart Manufacturing team partnered with the Human Capital
						practice. The Human Capital team conducted a survey that uncovered root causes of the manufacturerâs talent
						issues, such as poor onboarding and lack of sufficient air conditioning in the facilities.
According to Burke, there were many talent questions that needed answers. âHow are workers promoted or
						trained to be managers and supervisors? How can they invest in employees long-term and improve the worker
						experience? Itâs important to keep people for a career and not just a job.â
To find these answers, they helped bridge the gap between the clientâs human resources and operations teams
						and developed a workforce plan aligned to both teamsâ needs. Additionally, Deloitteâs Smart Manufacturing
						and Human Capital teams engaged the workforce by having the manufacturerâs team members work directly with
						them to advance their operations. One of the plant managers is co-leading the smart manufacturing workstream
						Tidd. The goal is to empower their own teams to become catalysts for lasting impact.
At The Smart Factory @ Wichita, we furthered the value of collaboration. The Smart Factory is where the
						manufacturerâs leadership across engineering, management, and operations were able to see possibilities come
						to life. We highlighted real-world use cases from companies that faced similar problemsâbut found different
						solutions designed for their specific smart manufacturing needs. By showcasing the art of the possible, the
						manufacturerâs path forward was centered on working together to create collective value across the entire
						business.




From transformers to transformation
To spearhead their smart manufacturing transformation, Burke and Tidd are helping implement a scalable platform
				that will help the organization see, control, and analyze its manufacturing data to allow engineers, operators,
				and site managers to make better decisions and become more productive. They are working with the transformer
				producerâs information technology and operational technology teams to integrate the solution into its legacy
				systems to enable greater visibility throughout its operations.
As Tidd says, this new oversight is an opportunity for everyone. âItâs been an exciting journey to work
				collaboratively across the ecosystemâs stakeholders to rapidly create and deploy the right platform for the
				right users with the right insights at the right time.â
Along with this, Burke and Tidd invited members of the manufacturerâs workforce to become drivers of the value
				delivered by the platform. A plant manager is overseeing the deployment and positioning his team to manage their
				own success. âItâs about empowering them to move from understanding what these new technologies are and whatâs
				being asked of them to believing in it and owning it,â says Tidd.
As the manufacturer continues to shape its smart manufacturing capabilities, Deloitteâs Smart Manufacturing
				team is helping it explore growth opportunities as well. For instance, the companyâs three-phase transformers
				generate 33% of its revenue but represent only 15% of the units produced. How can the manufacturer increase
				production on those transformers to drive revenue and deliver on demand?
Like transformers, Deloitteâs Smart Manufacturing team is spearheading change, guiding the currents to meet the
				clientâs needs. By beginning with one of the manufacturerâs campuses, they are understanding the inner workings
				of its operations. What the team learns there will enable the scaling of bespoke solutions across the clientâs
				many campuses. By leveraging The Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita experiential center and Deloitteâs Smart
				Manufacturing offering, the transformer manufacturer is supercharging its operations to convert the possible
				into competitive advantage.

Building a Smart
						Hospital of the Future
A conversation with Deloitte's Emily Duncan and Kurt
						Banas
April 2023 |
							Deloitte Consulting





"How can I do more with less?"
That question is plaguing many organizations post-pandemic but arguably none more so than those in the health
					care industry. As understaffed, overloaded health care systems reach a breaking point, the need for a smarter,
					integrated approach is more apparent than ever. 
Emily Duncan, senior manager with Deloitte Consulting, and Kurt Banas, principal with Deloitte Consulting,
					are helping one of the largest health care systems in the world apply a âsmart factoryâ approach to their
					organization. 
âOur client realizes that concepts from other industries are also applicable to health care and should be
					leveraged,â says Duncan.
Built upon the ideas and tools exemplified at The Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita experiential center,
					Deloitte is partnering with a leading health care system to create a âsmart hospitalâ of the futureâand
					setting the standard for an entire industry. 


From factory floor to hospital floor
Even though a hospital floor is different from a factory floor, there are more similarities than meet the
					eye. Patients certainly must be treated differently than data points, but thereâs valuable information
					available to make a hospital more efficientâand more effective. "It's all about operating at the lowest cost
					with extremely high-quality outcomes, and our client recognizes that," says Banas. 
The health care organization drew inspiration from different sources to build a foundation for this new smart
					hospital, and much of it came from the use cases we bring to life at The Smart Factory @ Wichita experiential
					center. 
"They keep coming to us because they know that we are innovating at The Smart Factory, and they trust our
					recommendations and ability to execute," says Duncan. "They welcomed us bringing ideas from outside their
					industry, which is not common with health care clients. We're excited they took such an innovative and leading
					approach."








Our client is at the forefront of the industry. Health care
								can be resistant to change and behind the curve, and Iâm so pleased they want to partner with us on that
								innovation and be seen as leaders in the industry. 
â Emily DuncanSenior Manager, Deloitte Consulting
							








The anatomy of a smart hospital
Seeing that knowledge is power, data is at the heart of the health care systemâs transformation. With
						patient safety and care prioritized, the organization is putting multiple use cases from The Smart Factory @
						Wichita to work.
Real-time locating software uses beacons to track movement throughout an organization. In the smart
						hospital, that means tracking patients, staff, medical equipment, physiciansâyou name it.  
"At any point, we can understand the movement of people and devices throughout the organization and
						understand bottlenecks to efficiency. And weâve been using this for years in many other industries," says
						Duncan. 
Computer vision uses artificial intelligence and deep learning models to train cameras to accurately
						identify and classify objectsâand then react to what they âsee.â Working with Deloitte, our client is in the
						beta stage of three computer vision use cases: 

Emergency department (ED) ambulance trackingâCameras in the ED bays identify when an ambulance arrives
							and departs, including specific vehicle information such as the ambulance company, rig number, and how
							long the EMS workers and patient needed to wait, among other data points.
Patient safety monitorsâTrained algorithms enable cameras to proactively analyze patient behavior and
							identify whether a patient is at risk of falling. A speaker integrated into the alert system communicates
							potential risk to the patient and alerts clinicians if a patient is at risk of falling or has, in fact,
							fallen.
Inventory managementâTrained cameras deployed in a hospital supply closet can detect how much of each
							item is on hand. For instance, if a bin of syringes is half-empty, the camera can learn that behavior and
							trigger a reorder of inventory without human intervention.
 
A custom-developed application on an iPad was created to expedite EMS check-in and check-out and integrates
						vital patient registration information with the hospitalâs electronic health record to speed up patient
						registration and care.
Through call and text analysis, powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing,
						the health care organization can quickly analyze immense volumes of data to understand primary topics and
						drivers behind patient and clinician communication. Topic modeling is then used to identify common and
						repeatable tasks with the goal of identifying automation opportunities to improve and streamline patient and
						clinician communication. Initial findings have resulted in the health care system expanding this work to
						additional hospitals with the goal of further understanding clinician adoption and utilization of
						communication tools.




Advancing the future of health care together
This partnership was built upon the use cases seen at The Smart Factory @ Wichita experiential centerâbut it
				was also built on trust. The health care system leaned on Deloitte to recommend the best vendors for each
				solution, based on a respect for our experience and the innovation happening at The Smart Factory. These
				advancements enable clinicians to act at the top of their license, removing common barriers to care so the
				health care workers can focus on what matters: spending more time with their patients. And as health systems
				continue to navigate providing care with increasingly fewer resources, technology like this can help
				organizations build smart hospitals now and for the future.

Going back to
						basics for space exploration
A conversation with Casey Dollinger, manager Deloitte
						Consulting
October 2022 |
							Deloitte Consulting





How many people does it take to build a rocket engine? That's a question Casey Dollinger, a manager with
					Deloitte Consulting, is helping an aerospace manufacturer answer by harnessing the power of The Smart Factory
					by Deloitte @ Wichita's experiential center. And turns out, the answer isn't as simple as it seems.
What started as a crew planning supply chain project quickly turned into a larger smart operations initiative
					that's reconfiguring the manufacturer's processes to improve resource and material planning and increase the
					delivery of mission-capable products. Project Sky is a go for launch.







âThey have some of the most advanced technology and
									machines in their factories. They're just missing some of the basics.â
â Casey DollingerManager, Deloitte Consulting
								








Seeing the big picture
Building rocket engines for space travel is a complicated matter. It involves some of the most advanced
							technology on the marketâand off the market, considering many of the companies in this industry use
							homegrown systems as a competitive advantage. 
But homegrown systems can be difficult to tie new technologies into, often with manual workarounds that
							result in limited access to data and smart analytics. In addition to using a homegrown system, the
							aerospace manufacturer lacked both a Material Requirements Planning (MRP) system and an Enterprise
							Resource Planning (ERP) system, which meant there was little visibility into the bigger picture. 
Just recently, at The Smart Factory @ Wichita, we helped the aerospace manufacturer's operations
							scheduling team explore a use case and provide speed to value of an automated tool that delivers a
							forecast on its engine production. This was the first time the manufacturer could provide a forecast to
							its CEO after years of production.
That's just one way The Smart Factory @ Wichita experiential center is helping the aerospace manufacturer
							envision what's possible. With the live production line, we can also show the impact of an end-to-end
							transformation and bring new opportunities to life while the manufacturer better defines its goals.

The big issue to solve: How can we help optimize the manufacturer's operations while the company
							continues to iterate and grow at an incredibly rapid pace?




Launching a partnership
To go big, you have to start small. âNow that they're growing and trying to scale production, it's clear many
					of their processes are not scalable. Many solutions were executed manually and outside the enterprise system,â
					says Dollinger. To ensure the manufacturer's new rockets and engines operate at capacity and can be produced
					at scale, we're looking at the end-to-end business processes, from engineering to manufacturing. âEngineering
					and planning don't have a systematic link to manufacturing objects nor a visible digital thread to what's
					happening on the factory floor, which leads to many of their challenges,â says Dollinger.
This digital thread component is key for the aerospace manufacturer and one of the primary use cases we bring
					to life at The Smart Factory @ Wichita. True to many startups, the manufacturer's solutions are often created
					in silos and do not work together. Dollinger says, âNow that they're trying to ramp up engine production, it's
					hard to get to their goal production rate because nothing is connected.â Innovation requires communication,
					and when we host organizations atThe Smart Factory by Deloitte @ Wichita, we take a step back to address the
					fundamentals first.







âThey're trying to build something that's never been built
									before. They're very empowered to be innovative and shoot for the stars, which drives a very creative
									culture.â
â Casey DollingerManager, Deloitte Consulting
								








Shooting for the stars
Once we get the basics down in terms of processes, we look forward to helping the aerospace manufacturer
							integrate its technology into each build, inputting sensors and adding real-time data to create a true
							smart factory. âLong-term, it's getting onto the shop floor with them and helping them work more
							efficiently once they have the correct information being captured upstream,â says Dollinger.
We are also working with Deloitte's Human Capital group to help manage and drive the manufacturer's
							organizational change. âA lot of projects are born from an entrepreneurial spirit, but they don't have the
							organizational change management to communicate those new solutions,â says Dollinger. We're helping bring
							awareness to these new programs and breaking down internal silos, while giving the client a competitive
							advantage moving forward.
It's thrilling to work with a company that literally shoots for the stars. Possibilities are everywhere,
							transformation is a baseline expectation. Where will this journey take us next? The sky (and beyond) is
							the limit.

Smart
						manufacturing: The complete package
November 2021 |
							Deloitte Consulting






Smart manufacturing has the power to transform. That's why so many manufacturers have taken the first step by
					investing in new equipment and technology. But, according to Jesse Storm, manager with Deloitte Consulting,
					technology is just part of the story.âOur mantra is people, process, and technology,â Storm said. âYes, you
					need the technology, but you also have to train people how to use it and to establish smart processes that
					maximize its efficiency.âWe recently helped one of our clients do just that.
The Challenge
We have a client that is a large packaging manufacturer specializing in making plastic containers for food
					and other household items. They were faced with a couple of issues and asked for our help. Three of their
					plants had older, inefficient equipment. And the fourth plant had newer equipment, but they didn't know how to
					use it.
The Smart Factory approach
Storm and his team took a two-pronged approach: intelligence gathering and data collection.
To begin the process of modernizing the equipment in their older plants, we spent six weeks interviewing
					everyoneâmaterial handlers, maintenance staff, floor operators, and more. We did a deep dive on what their
					responsibilities were and what core issues they faced.
At the newer plant, we took a similar approach. We spent a lot of time with their engineers to understand how
					one product in particular was made at this plant, from end to end. We learned that it was a new plastic
					packaging product that could be used for hot fillings, like pizza sauce. It had the same thermal properties as
					glass but was less expensive. However, the process was brand new and very unstable; if you didn't know how to
					operate the machine properly, the hot fillings could melt the plastic, which was happening. As a result,
					orders were backing up.
At the same time, we were collecting all the data points from every machine in order to gauge the efficiency
					levels of each.
What Happened next
We took a mix of what we heard from the people at the plants and married that with the data we collected to
					develop custom smart factory solutions to address their problems.We focused on improving real-time visibility
					into key data points during the plastic bottle manufacturing processâlike plastic temperatures and air tube
					pressure, for example.We implemented real-time alerts to spot issues quicker and send to the appropriate
					person, be it a maintenance person or programmer.We established continuous product inspection so they could
					perform check-ins during manufacturing and improve overall design.There were other solutions, as well: set
					point optimization to maximize quality and yield, and recipe optimization to determine the best formulation
					for each plastic product.We also implemented a plant control tower that provided a summary of factory
					performance with Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) insights. We gave them access to this information via web
					browser, tablets, and TV screens directly on the production line. We also distributed digital radios for
					alerts and sent out email notifications.








"Perhaps the most important piece is training people to be
								more effective at their jobs."
â Jesse Storm
							








Looking ahead
While Jesse is proud of all the work his team did, he said it's important to remember that smart
						manufacturing is not a âflick the switch and it works like magicâ proposition.
âThe technology's important, of course,â Storm added. âBut the process is just as critical. âIt's thinking
						about how we can do things differently. For example, instead of writing things down on paper to track
						production, what if we redesigned the process so it's automatically reported to the system?â
The client saw great results at one plant because there was an employee who was a little tech savvy but
						also really curious. And he kept finding new ways to use the data to solve all sorts of problems. Quick
						example: To ensure correct label placement on bottles, they would have to spend $30,000 per line to check
						that. But with the data points we collected, this one employee discovered they didn't need to spend that
						money because the data showed when a label wasn't properly placed.
Storm was asked if there's anything else that other manufacturers can learn from this experience. âYes,
						absolutely,â he said. âThat you don't have to overhaul all your equipment. There are different ways to get
						started and see benefits. It just requires a little bit of training, discipline, process, and technology.â

What makes smart
						manufacturing so cool?
A conversation with Michelle Davis, manager at Deloitte
						Consulting
January 2022 |
							Deloitte Consulting





Today we're hanging with Michelle Davis.
Hey, hey!
So, can you please tell us a little about your background and journey?
It actually started when I was interningâI helped deploy a custom constraint visualization and prioritization
					production tool that focused client efforts on tackling the most important issues first, which reduced the
					span of the overall production build approximately 15%. We developed a cloud-based dynamic scheduler for a
					client from start to finish. To me, that's pretty cool.
What was your first smart factory project?
It combines a lot of the techy side of things that play to my strengths: the quantitative components and
					data-driven decision-making that I really enjoy, the functional focus on how we can improve our customer's
					operations and ultimately transform the way that they build and deliver aircraft or other end products.

What is the impact of using dynamic scheduling technology?
Agility and utilization! We have a saying here: Your perfect optimized plan is outdated in less than five
					minutes, because the production environment is changing that quickly. It's affected by factors like who showed
					up today? What material is available? What engineering or quality holds exist? And because work is changing at
					such a rapid pace, it's challenging to understand and incorporate all of those variables manually. What you
					get, then, is a âbest guessâ or a âbest as of 6 a.m. this morningâ schedule with teams reacting to all of the
					changes that keep popping up.
By using dynamic scheduling technologies, you can actually force-rank everything you have in the shop by
					priority and prompt teams to work on the most important available task they can perform.
OK, let's talk about the future of smart factory. What gets you excited?

It's still so new with a lot of growth potential. How we've solved problems in one sector won't work exactly
					the same way in another. Additional computational power and technologies make things we couldn't do years ago
					achievable now, and I expect that trajectory to continue.
I'm also excited to bring smart factory thinking to new industries. Deloitte has a lot of smart factory
					experience in heavy industrial products, but what about in life sciences and health care? What about in food
					and beverage? It's exciting to think about the unique challenges of each industry and client and how to go
					about solving them.
You're also a big believer in The Smart Factory @ Wichita.
Yes, because there's been a lot of talk about smart manufacturingâwhat it can do, how it'll change
					everything. But I think it's important to get out of your own factory and come see what's possibleâon a live
					production line. And that's what we have here. Seeing is believing.
What do you want people to take away from their visit to the SF@W?
I want them to believe! That they can start to build and scale a smart factory solution nowâtoday. Not just
					someday. Deloitte's done a great job of getting key players on board. You can have intelligent conversations
					about your specific challenges with them. It's an amazing ecosystem, a âwho's whoâ of smart manufacturing.

You can really see the potential of smart manufacturing technology, can't you?
				
Ha, well, I got my B.A. in graphic design and fine arts, with an emphasis on painting. So I've always been

A conversation with Kimberly Hamrick, manager at
						Deloitte Consulting
December 2021 |
							Deloitte Consulting





Today, we'd like to welcome Kimberly Hamrick.
Thanks, I'm excited to be here!
So, Kimberly, what got you interested in smart manufacturing?
Well, I came out of school focused on analytics and tried to figure out what that meant to clients. And I
					found that it's a good combination of tech, application development, and using data in new and interesting
					ways to improve how clients deliver products.
My first few years at Deloitte, I focused in planning analytics and supplier analytics and how we could help
					clients drive their planning processes in a new way. A two-to-three-week engagement with an aerospace client
					was my first foray into smart manufacturing. That project has turned into two-and-a-half years because they
					continue to see enormous value.
What gets you excited about The Smart Factory, specifically?
It combines a lot of the techy side of things that play to my strengths: the quantitative components and
					data-driven decision-making that I really enjoy, the functional focus on how we can improve our customer's
					operations and ultimately transform the way that they build and deliver aircraft or other end products.

What's the most surprising element in smart manufacturing applications?
Well, change is happening fast in smart manufacturing. Very fast. But what surprises me, sometimes, is how
					long it takes for organizations to pivot and act. You know, there's a real hesitation to dive in and make the
					investment, which I feel is somewhat inevitable.
What's the coolest project you've worked on so far?
I would have to say âprojectsâ pluralâbecause everything we've done for our aerospace client is very cool. It
					all started with dynamic scheduling and asset tracking. We really hit the ground running, integrating supplier
					systems, arming assets with sensors, and installing an RFID ecosystem to track and trace materials. We also
					developed a cloud-based, dynamic scheduler that tracks materials, monitors machine health, and dispatches job
					assignments in real time. It simplifies visual management and ensures that resources and people are in the
					right place, at the right time.
What have you learned about the power of smart factory solutions?
That they're very contagious! Once clients see the value of a particular solution, they want more. They get
					excited when they see how the same thinking and technology from one use case might be applied in a different
					part of the business. For example, our dynamic scheduling and asset tracking work created more opportunities
					and use cases for the same client. It's been a really great experience to see smart factory solutions gain
					traction, take off, and grow at such a trajectory. I'm so proud to have been a part of it.
Why should organizations visit The Smart Factory @ Wichita?
First of all, I can remember when The Smart Factory @ Wichita was just a crazy idea on paper being discussed
					internally at the partner level. So, it's amazing to see what it's become: an at-scale smart manufacturing
					facility, just down the street from my aerospace client.
Why should clients visit? Because now they can see with their own eyes that smart manufacturing is real, not
					just some abstract, buzzwordy promise. Clients come in and they start to see what's possibleâthe long- and
					short-term benefits. It's a good accelerator where you can brainstorm ideas and see them in practiceâeven on a
					small scale.
That's a very good analysis.
Well, that is my business.

Smart
						manufacturing: The secret Ingredient to a bakery's success
Deloitte
							Consulting






Smart manufacturing takes a lot of thought and planningâfor us and our clients. âIt's more of a
					transformation than a tactical project,â said Brian Kiefer, manager for Deloitte Consulting. For one of our
					clients, that transformation was just as much a change in mindset as a change in operations.
âThey had different equipment, different makes and models, different processesâeven within the same bakery,â
					Kiefer said.
But with six miles of networking cable and a whole lot of know-how, we helped their operations go from
					old-school to next-gen.
The Challenge
Our client is a large manufacturer of baked goods with 40+ different bakeries, each operating as its own
					independent company. In addition, the bakeries were using different materials and machines with no visibility
					into their operations unless you were on the factory floor. Our client needed to improve efficiencies at their
					bakeries and create a networked digital-first approach.
The Smart Factory approach
As things stood, there was no way for our client to see what was happening on their factory floors unless
					they were physically there. Our end goal was to create a world where the general manager could wake up at 6
					a.m. and grab their phone to see how the night shift ran.
Kiefer and his colleagues employed a Smart Factory dream team in their approach: operational technology and
					information technology. By asking the right questions and proving our knowledge of factory operations, we
					gained our client's trust to create a network of their 40+ bakeries. Once connected, we could pull and analyze
					vital information in real time.
What Happened next
To start things off, we spoke to upper management, operators, and middle management, determining that each
					person needed different intel from the same data. With those users in mind, we outlined which information we
					needed to gather from each machine.
Next came the fun partâlaying down those six miles of networking cable to capture key data points from the
					machines on their factory floors. This move was vital to optimizing operations, leaning on sensor-enabled
					monitoring to reduce equipment downtime and predict bigger issues.
Those sensors also helped our client automate quality inspections. Real-time data gives an inside look at
					what's happening on every factory line without the need for someone to physically be there. You could see
					whether a dough proofer was running hot and adjust immediately, rather than wait to see that the dough was
					over proofed.
All of that data is easily accessed on a custom application with different views for each user, including
					specialized, real-time alerts. Now it wasn't just the machine operators who knew that the mixer on Line 1 was
					slowâthe CEO could see that data live on the app and immediately take action.
Looking ahead
While Jesse is proud of all the work his team did, he said it's important to remember that smart
					manufacturing is not a âflick the switch and it works like magicâ proposition.
âThe technology's important, of course,â Storm added. âBut the process is just as critical. âIt's thinking
					about how we can do things differently. For example, instead of writing things down on paper to track
					production, what if we redesigned the process so it's automatically reported to the system?â

Smart story
Is your digital
						backbone strong enough?
A conversation about MES with Siemens' Raj Ragupathi
					
May 2022 |
							Deloitte Consulting






Raj Ragupathi's love for smart manufacturing started before it was even a thing. As a high school intern with
					his family's automotive manufacturing business in India, he was fascinated with this intersection where ideas
					and design become reality. 
Today as the digital manufacturing transformation leader at Siemensâthe company is also a Founding Sponsor of
					The Smart Factory @ Wichitaâhe's living his passion to bring new ideas to life. But not all ideas are created
					equally. âYou can have great ideas, but you have to make them quick, at the highest quality, at the lowest
					cost, and better than your competitor,â Ragupathi says. The key to getting there? Digital transformation.

Digital transformation takes many forms, especially here at The Smart Factory @ Wichita. It can start with
					design transferâwhere a product design gets transferred into the manufacturing environmentâor it can start at
					the manufacturing execution system (MES) level. Every project is value-driven and begins by understanding our
					customer. âWe get to talk to some of the best-in-class manufacturing and engineering practitioners on how they
					are realizing their vision today and what their aspirations are for the future.â Then, Ragupathi says, it's
					pairing that vision with the right software solutions to help them get there.
Where to begin?
Sometimes seeing is believing. Ragupathi says the biggest differentiator of The Smart Factory @ Wichita is
					being able to show clients how a transformation would actually work. âIt's not just a theoryâthey can see it
					for real, and that's a key step.â
Beyond seeing their potential, Ragupathi helps customers define their problem. âIf you dig deeper, you make
					them realize we're not just solving a small problem, but that there's an underlying bigger cause.â It starts
					with vision building and value mapping, then advances on to prioritizing and deploying the solution.








âWhat people sometimes forget is going back to the basics.
								If you go back to the basicsâmaking it quicker, cheaper, better than othersâyou need a good digital
								backbone to absorb the changes as they're thrown to manufacturers.â
â Raj RagupathiDigital Manufacturing Transformation Leader at Siemens
							








MES in action
Siemens uses MES as part of The Smart Factory solution to make our customers' manufacturing processes
						quicker, cheaper, and better than their competitors. Here's how it works:
It begins with traceability. Everything that happens during the production process is traceable. MES
						takes that information in without someone having to write it down, keeping a digital record.
This includes genealogy. What materials make the product? Did the required materials go into the
						product or were some of them expired? MES takes care of material-related complexities.
And it all hinges on quality. MES ensures you're building the product to its specifications for
						consistency and value. By providing visibility into the manufacturing process, MES helps manufacturers
						improve efficiencies and ensure quality. And beyond that, it's a huge compliance driver in regulated
						industries, according to Ragupathi. For years, regulators have had to rely on paper records, which include
						human errors and are often missing pages. Small mistakes like this can turn into big problems (and fines)
						during the regulation process.




Scaling beyond semiconductors
MES got its start thanks to the semiconductor industry. âThere's not a single medium-large semiconductor fab
				anywhere in the world that doesn't have some MES solution. It's part of their DNA,â says Ragupathi. Beyond
				chips, he sees real opportunity across industries where MES can make a difference. Some industries are already
				using them, like high-tech electronics. But others are lagging, like the medical industry. âThe products they
				make are so innovative, so lifesaving. But their manufacturing systems are still stuck in the 19th century with
				paper and manual processes.â
Embarking on a digital transformation can seem like a far-off dream rather than an actionable plan. But
				Ragupathi always goes back to what first enamored him with smart manufacturing all those years ago. âPeople
				think smart manufacturing is abstractâa theory. But it's actually very practical. It's having the digital
				backbone to make ends meet for manufacturers.â Where ideas and designsânot far-off dreamsâbecome reality. 












âIn a world with constant innovation, successful ideas are
								scalable ideas. Think cell phones, cars, semiconductorsâ¦they are constantly iterating, yet consistently
								deliver.â
â Raj RagupathiDigital Manufacturing Transformation Leader at Siemens
